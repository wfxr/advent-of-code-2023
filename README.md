# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/stats)

I am trying to write the solutions

- with error handling
- without `unwrap`
- without `unsafe`
- without dependencies

To run solutions:

```
cargo run --release [day_number]
```

To test solutions:

```
cargo test [day_number]
```

To benchmark solutions:

```
cargo bench [day_number]
```
